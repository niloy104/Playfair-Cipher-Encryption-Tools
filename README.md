This project implements a Playfair Cipher encryption tool using Html,Css,JavaScript. The Playfair Cipher is a cryptographic technique that encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a 5x5 key table of letters.

## Features

- Encryption of plaintext using the Playfair Cipher algorithm.
- Responsive web interface for inputting the key and plaintext.
- Decryption of ciphertext back to plaintext.
- Modern and visually appealing design.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Usage

1. Input a key and plaintext into the designated fields.
2. Click the "Encrypt" button to generate the ciphertext.
3. Optionally, click the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the ciphertext back to plaintext.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Ensure that your browser supports JavaScript.
